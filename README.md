### Day 12: February 6, 2022
**Progress:** 
- Enrolled in a ReactJS course (on Scrimba)
- Solved some advent of code   

### Day 11: February 5, 2022
**Progress:**
- Completed the CSS crash course that I started on Day 10
- Enrolled in a 7-hour JS course (on Scimba) and completed it (Because I was familiar with about 50% of the course material)
- Enrolled in a 1-hour EC6 course (on Scimba) and completed it

**Thoughts:** I really like the Scimba website, it makes learning much more easy and fun  

### Day 10: February 4, 2022
**Progress:**
- I enrolled in a CSS crash course 
- I also solved  some advent of code puzzles 

**Thoughts:** I originally wanted to take a course on web3, however in the first lecture of the course there was a recommendation about a another frontend course in Scimba (like a pre-request).  

The moment I entered the Scimba website, I fell in love with it and decided to take a couple more courses on web-development.     

So. Here I am enrolled in a crash course on HTML and CSS and planning to take 3 more courses (the first on JavaScript, the second on EC6, and the last on ReactJS)  


### Day 9: February 3, 2022
**Project:** Photo Editor Website
**Progress:** 
- Fixed lots of bugs and added full support for small screens
- Solved some AOC Challenges  

**Thoughts:** There something special about advent of code puzzles, unlike other coding-puzzles website, AOC is very easy to understand but challenging to solve

I really loved the puzzles
