**Thoughts:** I am really surprised by the problems in kick start, it doesn't just focus on problem solving skills but it also heavily relied on algorithms and data structures.  
You don't just have to come up with a solution, instead you need to come up with a very optimized solution

### Day 13: February 7, 2022
**Thoughts:** I didn't achieve a lot of progress in this day. I kinda took it as a break. (I did code for at least 1 hour for the challenge)

### Day 11: February 5, 2022
**Progress:**

- Enrolled in a 7-hour JS course (on Scimba) and completed it (Because I was familiar with about 50% of the course material)
- Enrolled in a 1-hour EC6 course (on Scimba) and completed it

**Thoughts:** I really like the Scimba website, it makes learning much more easy and fun  

### Day 10: February 4, 2022
**Progress:**
- I enrolled in a CSS crash course 
- I also solved  some advent of code puzzles 

**Thoughts:** I originally wanted to take a course on web3, however in the first lecture of the course there was a recommendation about a another frontend course in Scimba (like a pre-request).  

The moment I entered the Scimba website, I fell in love with it and decided to take a couple more courses on web-development.     

So. Here I am enrolled in a crash course on HTML and CSS and planning to take 3 more courses (the first on JavaScript, the second on EC6, and the last on ReactJS)  


### Day 9: February 3, 2022
**Project:** Photo Editor Website
**Progress:** 
- Fixed lots of bugs and added full support for small screens

**Thoughts:** There something special about advent of code puzzles, unlike other coding-puzzles website, AOC is very easy to understand but challenging to solve

I really loved the puzzles
